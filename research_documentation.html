        <h2>Research Preface</h2>
        <p>
          To kick off the Capstone project experience, our team began by first seeking to balance our understanding of the autonomous vehicle (AV) space. One concern for us from the start was that some members of the team have worked in some capacity with the car or AV space, such as through an independent study or from full-time positions before the program. We wanted everyone on the team to be as equally educated in the AV space as possible to prevent any unnecessary dependencies moving forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          We familiarized ourselves about the levels of autonomous driving ranging from 0 to 5, with 0 being non-autonomous, 3 being Uber’s mixed initiative pilots, and 5 being fully autonomous, as well as the challenges of each. This helped ground us to the realism of the AV space in the near future, with better expectations that a “living room on wheels” is not viable anytime soon. Since the idea of complete, level-5 autonomy is not viable for at least five to ten years, our team decided to focus on a sooner reality, settling for level-3 mixed initiative since it offers also a unique opportunity to examine the handoff/takeover opportunities between the driver and the vehicle.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also read into some of the infrastructural ideas being tossed around, such as the idea of a “Smart Crosswalk” or a “Smart City” and how the AV landscape was hoping to leverage some capabilities of the physical environment surrounding it. After some consideration, however, we later decided that the concept of smart cities would be out of scope for us, since we cannot easily depend on infrastructure and policy to be supportive as of now.  Our interest in focusing on a more immediate reality further strengthened our decision to focus on level-3 autonomy.

      <h2>Secondary Research</h2>
        <p>
          The team conducted a great deal of secondary research and literature review during the first 1.5 months of the project.  This dive into existing research helped us learn about the autonomous vehicle space, both its current state and speculated future.  Our readings delved into a multitude of areas, ranging everywhere from the ethics of AV passenger responsibility, to implementations of augmented reality displays in AVs.  However, our most revisited and essential research assets were largely made up of:
          <ul>
            <li>Studies examining the desired user experience of AVs</li>
            <li>Identification and desires of target users of AVs</li>
            <li>Activities of major players in the AV space</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row inner-row">
      <h3>User Experience of Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the incomplete and unfinished technological development of AVs, it probably won’t come as a surprise that there has not yet been enough attention given to the user experience of autonomous vehicles.  However, we did find a handful of studies outlining some of the largest problem areas at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trust of the vehicle is one of the most prominent issues facing human interaction with AVs.  Suggested solutions to this include providing the driver with some choice over navigation despite the automated GPS system, ensuring that the user can interact with an AV in a straightforward and flexible manner, and having the car clearly express its reliability to the user in a method of communication that they can easily understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many sources have expanded on this last point, citing transparency as an integral tool for increasing user trust.  One study looked at what kind of transparency is most advantageous, and found that there’s a delicate balance of providing enough information to put the driver at ease, but not so much that it overloads or leads to overreliance.  More specifically, this study found that telling the user why the car is doing something provides this desired information balance, but if focus is instead on telling the user what the car is going to do, this leads to overtrust of the system and poor takeover of the vehicle when necessary.  Overreliance is a prominent safety issue in the AV space as it leads to poor supervision and takeover, which are still highly necessary with the current level of AV technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team also came across the concept of strategic distraction during our research.  One study by Wendy Ju found that users in an AV who were watching videos on an iPad performed better at takeover tasks than those who were just asked to supervise the AV system.  This demonstrated that a way of mediating overreliance on the automated system and disengagement from supervision responsibilities is to engage the user in a certain degree of distraction.  This researcher is also noteworthy as she provided the direct inspiration for our Wizard of Oz autonomous car set-up in our primary research phase.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row inner-row">
      <h3>Learnings from current AV systems</h3>
      <p>
        We also encountered research on current AV systems and their limitations.  One study discussed how users of Tesla Autopilot complain of poor, spotty lane detection, and abrupt braking, acceleration, and deceleration.  Another Tesla study found unreliable handling of subtle and complex road conditions.  In addition, this paper discussed the importance of a co-driving system, in which the human must monitor the autonomous driving system and be available for takeover during AV failures of environment context.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another interesting finding was Waymo’s central UX principles for their autonomous driving system.  They emphasize four tenants: giving the driver the info they need, helping to anticipate future events, communicating the car’s response to events on the road to the user, and finally, helping passengers safely engage with the vehicle.  This demonstrates their consideration of transparency and an intuitive means of communication with the vehicle, which is also reflected in research mentioned previously.
      </p>
    </div>
    <hr/>
    <div class="row inner-row" id="av_users">
      <h2>Users of Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
      <p>
        Our team also strived to learn about the future target audience for fully-functioning, commercially-available AVs.  We found many theories revolving around the concept of a shared autonomy future, meaning that in the next couple decades we can expect wide adoption of autonomous ride-sharing vehicles as an alternative to car ownership.  A number of studies described the most likely adopters of this shared autonomy future to be young, urban, educated, tech-savvy, environmentally conscious people who currently do not have a strong desire to own cars due to their environment, and who use ride-share services now.  One study also mentioned that those most likely to own autonomous vehicles in the future, instead of opting for the shared autonomy model, are individuals who currently own vehicles and have not tried ride-share services.  This research provides some perspective for who our ideal demographics are to test our designs going forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also found a small amount of research on what people might want to do with the newfound free time that comes from AVs, as this is integral to the non-driving aspect of the AV user experience.  Unsurprisingly, we found that people want to do what they do already in many other travel contexts - talk to others, text and call friends and family, listen to music, daydream, eat and drink, and browse the internet.  This helps inform what facilitation of these activities we should provide, and also how we can leverage these desires in strategic distraction methods.

    <div class="row inner-row" id="major_players">
      <h2>Major Players in the Autonomous Vehicle Domain</h2>
      <p>
        Our team also assembled some shared repositories for information regarding key companies in AV research and development. We focused on some of the efforts of external players, such as Waymo, Tesla, Uber, and more of the traditional car manufacturers below.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row inner-row">
      <h3>Tesla Autopilot</h3>
      <p>
        The existing implementation of Tesla autopilot provides an approximately level-2 experience of autonomous driving. There exists a level of takeover and handover where the car is either in autopilot or not in autopilot. While is autopilot, the car is able to control speed (as in relative cruise control, being aware of distance to vehicles ahead) as well as lane positioning and can perform gradual turns and bends. An important note is that the Tesla vehicle, while in autopilot mode, does not observe stop signs or traffic lights: it simply rolls through. This can be concerning to a Tesla user in autopilot mode if they are unfamiliar with the system’s limitations and helps to foster a sense of danger to the user in autopilot mode. Tesla also has controls on the steering wheel for the driver to fine-tune the speed limits as well as tailing distance to the car ahead. Currently, these controls are implemented as knobs.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row inner-row">
      <h3>Uber ATG</h3>
      <p>
        Uber is currently piloting its level-3 autonomous vehicles in several major cities in the United States (namely Pittsburgh, Phoenix, and the San Francisco bay area). Uber’s model of shared driving experiences remains, with the customer of the Uber service being simply a passenger in the vehicle while employees of Uber are drivers, engaging in takeover and handover with the vehicle. The vehicle features LIDAR technology atop the car, as well as a tablet interface within the back-seat area of the vehicle to portray vehicular transparency to the customer.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row inner-row">
      <h3>Waymo</h3>
      <p>
        Waymo is operating in a similar space to Uber ATG, where they are providing an on-demand ridesharing service to customers involving approximately level-3 autonomous vehicles. Waymo allows for the user to initialize the ride, with a “Start Ride” button. Once the ride has started, Waymo also uses a tablet interface to convey information about the ride to the end user, such as a localized map and estimated time of arrival, but also information about the car itself (including what the car is detecting through its LIDAR, radar, sound, and other sensory technology). Furthermore, the car always affords the user the ability to pull over, with a “pull over” button displayed to the user. The goals for Waymo are to provide a clear interface for a passenger to understand more about the vehicle as well as interface with the vehicle.
      </p>
      <p> 
        From a functional perspective, Waymo and Uber are similar in their goals for the customer in a ridesharing experience. The technology is very similar as well, highlighted by a 2017 lawsuit in which Waymo will receive 0.34 percent of Uber’s equity, valued at $245 million.
      </p>

    <div class="row inner-row">
      <h3>Concept Cars</h3>
      <p>
        With a history of engineering prowess, the traditional concept car companies also have a fair stake in the realm of autonomous vehicle technology. Note that the concept cars mainly focus on level-4 or 5 autonomy (with the exception of Audi, who is on the cusp of level-3 in production today).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row inner-row">
      <h6>Audi</h6>
      <p>
        Audi has declared itself to be at the forefront of autonomous vehicle technology in commercial cars, and for good reason. In 2017, Audi unveiled its luxury A8 Sedan which features an “AI traffic jam pilot” in which the car can handle acceleration, braking, steering, and more under 37mph, so long as there is a physical barrier between the two sides of the highway. The key is that it would not require any driver attention in those moments. Audi has also claimed to have been partnering with Nvidia to sell level 4 AVs by 2020, however whether or not they are still on target remains to be seen.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row inner-row">
      <h6>BMW/Rolls Royce/Renault</h6>
      <p>
        Luxury carmaker BMW is also looking to expand into the AV landscape, with an unveiling of a “living room on wheels” designed for the future of autonomous vehicles (level-5, full autonomy). The car itself does not feature a steering wheel or any traditional controls. Instead, it has a large television for entertainment, since attention would not be needed on the road. Rolls Royce is also approaching the full autonomous space as a living room on wheels. While neither has implemented above level-3 autonomy, BMW has some standard aspects of autonomous driving in its vehicles today (such as adaptive cruise control), but remains in research of level-5 autonomy.

      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>
        After completing secondary research and exploring exactly what is being accomplished in the field of autonomous vehicles, our team then sought to enumerate our personal questions surrounding the autonomous vehicle space in order to figure out both what we were interested in as a team, and any hierarchical structure that could arise. We performed a post-it note activity, where each member of the team wrote individual questions they had on post-it notes and then grouped alike questions on the board, leading to higher buckets to classify such information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We originally had over eighty questions which we decided to narrow down based on several limiting factors, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Was this question (or grouping of questions) feasible with our technical abilities?</li>
          <li>Does this question (or grouping of questions) offshoot into political or ethical issues larger than what we feel we can accomplish in a few months?</li>
          <li>Is this question (or grouping of question) more focused on infotainment than the actual AV aspects of the car?</li>
        </ul>
        Below are our original labeled buckets of questions, with some additional information about each:

        Upon enumerating our list of motivating questions, our team set out to construct a research plan to dictate our efforts moving forward. We looked to combine our known research methods with our questions in a means that would best help narrow down what we would focus on. We also sought to prioritize questions that seemed more fundamental to a mixed-initiative vehicle experience.

        Considering our research method choices, we decided to broadened the range of techniques used to explore the domain in order to attack the AV space from as many angles as possible. We cared about first trying to learn all we could about the domain from experts or those involved with AVs right now (such as owners of Tesla vehicles with autopilot or car salespeople). We also recognized the importance of constructing our own simulations to help us better elicit user emotions. This immediately resulted in our Wizard of Oz study (WoZ).

      <h3>Wizard of Oz (WoZ)</h3>
      <p>
        In order to explore issues of the user’s sense of trust, safety, control, and enjoyment, we created a “Wizard of Oz” (WoZ) experiment simulating the experience of being a passenger in a self-driving car.  A real driver, obscured by a foam core divider, operated the vehicle at all times with the participant in the passenger seat.  We also had a facilitator in the backseat prompting the participant with questions and taking notes, in addition to cameras recording audio and visual information facing the participant and out the windshield.  Participants were given the impression that the driver was there for liability reasons and that the vehicle was operating itself.  Despite our simple set-up, majority of participants stated at the end of the study that they thought it was a fully-operating self-driving vehicle.
      </p>
      <img src="images/WoZ.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
      <p>
        Users were taken on a fixed loop route that included planned critical incidents like stop signs, navigating pedestrian-heavy intersections, and unprotected left turns, plus inevitable unplanned incidents like halted mail trucks and other cars blocking the road while parking.
      </p>
      <img src="images/course.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
      <p>
        Participants were instructed to “think aloud” during the entire drive, which is a self-explanatory user research technique used to find problem areas in a system.  The facilitator took notes on these comments, and prompted the user after every critical incident to describe what they expected and how they felt about the events that took place.  Our team conducted 11 of these WoZ experiments with a  quasi-representative sample of participants recruited from Carnegie Mellon University and Craigslist.

    <div class="row inner-row">
      <h6>Tesla Interviews</h6>
      <p>
        We conducted phone interviews with eight Tesla owners to understand their experience with Tesla’s Autopilot system, which is the most advanced semi-autonomous driving system currently available.  These users represented our best access to the experience of autonomous car users, who don’t currently exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Members of our team asked Tesla owners about reasons they like or dislike Tesla Autopilot, what driving situations make them uncomfortable, when they turn it on or off, and if they wish anything about the experience was different.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row inner-row">
      <h6>Car Enthusiast Interviews</h6>
      <p>
        We also conducted interviews over the phone and in person with nine self-identified car enthusiasts to learn about what people love about driving, and how we might retain that enjoyment in an autonomous driving system.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were asked about their experience with cars, what they love about their current vehicles, their thoughts on the future of cars, and what they think about maintaining car culture in an increasingly autonomous future.

    <h3>Affinity Diagramming</h3>

      After gathering all our interviews from Tesla drivers, car enthusiasts, and our WoZ participants, we set on the task of converting all this raw data into insights.  To do this, we conducted affinity diagramming, turning 1,100+ data points into a series of hierarchical groupings in order to uncover patterns in user comments.  Select different categories below to see overviews of our findings.  “I” statements represent the summarized sentiments of multiple users.

                  <li>It gets annoying when the AV drives more cautiously than I would.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>I’m okay with the AV’s quick maneuvers when it’s just me, but I want it to drive differently when my family is in the car.</li>
                  <li>When the car is in Autopilot, it drives too cautiously.</li>
                  <li>I turn off Autopilot when I want to drive more aggressively.</li>

    <h3>Affinity Diagramming</h3>
    <p>
      Based on our high-level groupings, our team identified six areas of exploration to take with us into the design phase. These were selected based upon the most supported findings in the data, problems that are currently unaddressed by other solutions, and finally what questions our team was most passionate about answering:
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row inner-row">
    <h6>The Moments that Build Trust</h6>
    <p>
      Users’ trust in the AV system increases based upon its performance in specific moments during the ride.  What are these moments, and how can we facilitate them?
    </p>
  </div> 
  <div class="row inner-row">
    <h6>Learning my Driving Preferences and Incorporating Feedback</h6>
    <p>
      Users want the AV to drive like they would.  How can users convey their driving preferences to the AV during the drive, and how should the vehicle acknowledge and incorporate this feedback?
    </p>
  </div>  
  <div class="row inner-row">
    <h6>Establishing Driver Agency</h6>
    <p>
      Users need reassurance that they have control over the vehicle, even when it is in autonomous driving mode.  How can we communicate that most effectively and make the user feel in control?
    </p>
  </div> 
  <div class="row inner-row">
    <h6>Personalized Interior Experiences</h6>
  </div>
  <div class="row inner-row">
    <p>
      Users want the car to recognize their desires and remember their preferences.  What specifically do users want or not want the car to do for them?
    </p>
  </div>     
  <div class="row inner-row">
    <h6>What to Make Transparent to the Driver</h6>
    <p>
      Users need the right amount of transparency into the workings of the AV system.  What is necessary to show,  what is too much, and how should this information be displayed?
    </p>
  </div> 
  <div class="row inner-row">
    <h6>Enjoyable Control of Autonomous Driving</h6>
  </div>
  <div class="row inner-row">
    <p>
      Users derive joy from controlling their vehicles.  How can this be retained in an AV system?
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row inner-row">
    <p>
      With the selection of these areas for exploration, our exploratory research phase came to close.  See the <a href='design.html'>Design</a> section to observe how these questions led our ideation process.
