            <p>Our unique interface provides a means for a human driver to interact with an AI which gives the driver a sense of control over a vehicle they are not directly driving. It provides unique affordances to help the human better understand how they can alter the performance of the car while the car is operating on its own, with multiple means of feedback. Most importantly, this complete interface for interacting with an autonomous vehicle pioneers new means of decision making between the vehicle and the human in a collaborative way.</p>

            <h4>Interfaces</h4>
            <p>
              Our bottom interface for control is interactive, allowing for users to send various commands to the vehicle based on external driving context. Through our <a href="research.html">research</a>, we understood the need to allow personalization in the autonomous driving experience, through the use of several various use cases including speed control, adjustment of the vehicle within a lane, and general binary decision making (a go/don’t go decision).
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                Graphic: Interface GIF for Speed/Lane position
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              For our speed and lane position interface, we recognized the need for users to have constant access to making these more continuous adjustments. We also understood the positional affordances of the four general cardinal directions and exposed them to provide affordances for controlling speed and positioning within a lane (or “lane nudging”).
            </p>

            <p>

              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Other driving factors, such as whether or not to make a right turn at a red light, are a bit more hazy, with opportunities presenting themselves but the personalization of the overall driving experience leaves these sorts of decisions undefined from the perspective of the AI. We call these binary decisions. We constructed an interface for these binary decisions that not only scales to meet the unpredictable nature of a drive, but ensures the user is making a calculated decision through a more dedicated “confirm” or “deny” action.

            <h4>Curvature</h4>
            <p>
              The most unique aspect of the overall design is the curved input control sitting below. The curvature provides affordances as to hand and finger positioning which allow the user to make more informed decisions about where their hand position is and where they wish to move to without needing to look and place the hand on the desired point. 
            </p>
            <h4>Secondary Monitor</h4>
            <!-- secondary monitor img to be added here -->
            <p>
              The need for visual feedback about controlling a car not being driven is critical. Being able to see whether or not the command requested by the human to the car was heard allows for better confidence in the autonomous driving experience. The monitor is synchronized with the curved input control to allow for real-time feedback on what alterations to the current drive can be made.
            </p>
            <h4>Innovative Decision Making (Section In Progress)</h4>
            <p>
              The complete control system allows for a relationship between the human and the AI in a means that is more collaborative than the traditional master/slave relationships of past technologies. The system leverages principles of Automotive Humanistic Intelligence (based off of the original definition of HI by A, B, and C) to reconstruct the driving experience to be a series of decisions for both the human and the car, with both players having a role in how the car performs.
